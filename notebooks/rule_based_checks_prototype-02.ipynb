    "# 02 - Prototyping Rule-Based Data Quality Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** This notebook translates the data risks identified in the exploration phase into concrete, automated validation rules. I prototype the checks here for rapid iteration before refactoring them into production-ready Python functions in the `src` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Checks Implemented:**\n",
    "1.  **Data Type Validation:** Ensures core columns are in the correct format for analysis.\n",
    "2.  **Completeness Check:** Flags missing values in critical columns.\n",
    "3.  **Uniqueness Check:** Identifies duplicate records for the same company and year.\n",
    "4.  **Volatility Check:** Detects year-over-year revenue changes that exceed a plausible threshold (±50%).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:** A detailed report and a snapshot dataset with initial flags, which will serve as input for the LLM-powered contextual analysis.\n"

Without this step, all subsequent numerical analysis would fail. In notebook 1, `REVENUE` column has been been confirmed as numeric so i will proceed to directly use the values. "
